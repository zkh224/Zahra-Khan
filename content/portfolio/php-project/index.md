A teamwork group project for Introduction to Database course where we built the school portal website. We mainly used PHP and mySQL to create the webpages that retrieves school database records from phpMyAdmin. The design and navigation menu are created by HTML/CSS. The website contains add, delete, and update PHP functions where you can edit the school records from Studnet, Administration, and Registrar pages. You can also submit the payment based on the student ID and check the balance in the Financials page.
