Petate.org is the communication platform for the Latinx community of Lexington. It is created for the ICT research project to understand the technology needs for the Latinx community as they have the technology barriers in accessing the realiable information especially COVID19 data. The website was also build as an opportunity for the members of the community to interact each other in Spanish pertaining to the local events in Lexington or discussion about health issues. 

This website is coded from scratch without the content management system. It is built on PHP instrastructure and designed with the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. There is some jQuery to add the interactive features. The COVID19 live data table is implemented with JSON, specifially from CovidActNow.org.
