My learning report for the fourth week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

This week we went back to focusing on the [definition of the content management system](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/content-management-system/). Reviewing the definition helps me in determining if a software system like Hugo is CMS or not.  


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

We didn't learn in-depth about content management systems outside of the Hugo system, but we have learned about different content management systems from [the reading assignment](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/content-management-system-essay-wordpress-drupal-internet-feature/) like Arc and Blogger. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

Established workflow is not the main topic of the class this week. We did the Hugo assignments individually, but will work on our group assignments by next week. 


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

We learned about the importance of CMS business in online media industries. From reading the article, I can identify better in which websites use the same CMS based on the web layout and features. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

I used the old assignment's instruction as my self-directed learning when I was learning to add menus on my Hugo assignment. From the text editor, I figured that the code, `weight` means the order of the menu items when I changed the numbers for each menu item's `weight`.
