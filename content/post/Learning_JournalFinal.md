This is my final post, reflecting on what I have learned from the classs. My learning report for the whole semester of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

I know fully understand content management from a wide variety of concepts. Before taking this class, I have a vague understanding of content system management. Now I know the integral parts of content system management. One of them is content aggregation which we see daily without even realizing it. I understand that there are different ways to navigate different contents because the content system management deliberately groups the contents in certain shapes.  For example, Wikipedia uses network content aggregation by clicking on the links within the page. The other important part of content system management I learned about is the plugins and extensions. Many content system management like WordPress and Wix offers plugins to customize the website according to the user's desire. Even though plugin offers a massive advantage in customization, it has the main drawback according to Barker's article, ["The Dark Side of Plugin Architectures"](https://uk.instructure.com/courses/1978051/assignments/10592355?module_item_id=24423077).  Updating the CMS software can have a negative impact on the installed plugins due to incompatibility.  Security risks are another drawback of using plugins which can make the website vulnerable. 


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

I know different kinds of content management systems after completing a semester. The following content management systems I have used so far are WordPress, GitHub, and Omeka. I think each offers advantages and limitations which suits someone's needs based on my experience of using them. WordPress is the most popular CMS because it is easy enough for non-tech people to use but offers customization options for the developers. GitHub is a great option for those who prefer to control content in the straightforward repository system. Omeka is the most unique content system management which I have used from my extra project assignment. It is the content management tool for collecting different kinds of archives from museum artifacts to photo galleries. It is a great content management system for displaying virtual exhibitions. Each content management system serves a different purpose based on the offered tools. Omeka is used for storing and displaying archive collections while many people use WordPress for both personal and business websites. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

I learn to improve my workflow in the last half of the semester.  Getting used to the weekly blog post helped me to communicate better with my group in the virtual setting. I noticed that I initiated often the assignments and expectations during the group communication. Whenever I am the admin, sometimes I remind my group members about their tasks because I want the blog post to be completed before the deadline.  Reviewing the three steps of the self-feedback (Establish the Standard, Describe the Situation, and Provide Next Steps) from the [last module](https://uk.instructure.com/courses/1978051/discussion_topics/12470317?module_item_id=24423143) has helped me to plan out my group's workflow for the final projects. I discuss with my group about our roles for each page (Resource Guide, Walkthrough, and Annotated Definitions) so that our workflow is efficient without confusion. Comparing our current progress with our standards gives me an idea of what I need to focus on. For my case, I need to first work on the first Resource Guide to add two more resources to fulfill the rubric's guideline of having ten or more resources listed. 


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

I can identify the technologies related to content management that we use in our daily lives without realizing it. From [Module 13](https://uk.instructure.com/courses/1978051/discussion_topics/12470299?module_item_id=24423082), we learn about different methods of money-making models on the internet like advertising, affiliated links, and sponsorship. It helped me understand why the content creators I follow use certain tactics of advertising and sponsorship to earn their self-income. I also understand better how the content creators organize and distribute their content by learning about multichannel content distribution from [Module 14](https://uk.instructure.com/courses/1978051/discussion_topics/12470318?module_item_id=24423147). Many of them rely on social media like Facebook and Instagram to keep in touch with their audience for their channels to remain strong. For example, following Simply Nailogical's Instagram allows me to know updates of their latest YouTube videos. Knowing internet monkey-making models and multichannel distribution provides me good insights on how the content creators and bloggers run and manage their online content. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

I use a variety of external resources while doing my assignments. I found the external resources through research as my self-directed learning because they answer the questions I have while working on the assignments. When I was exploring Omeka CMS for my extra project assignment, I was a little bit lost so I watched Omeka tutorials from YouTube. This helped me know where to navigate in Omeka including knowing how to publish the post and collections. For the weekly blog posts assignment, I sometimes use W3Schools to find tips about HTML and CSS coding if I am the developer. Using these external resources from my self-directed knowledge has provided me the additional skills.
