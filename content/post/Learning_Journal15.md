My learning report for the fifteenth week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

We reviewed the concepts of effective peer feedback this week. 

**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

For this week, we didn't compare different kinds of content management systems.


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

I was the developer for this week's blog post where I created the framework of the HTML template. For the extra project, I led my group in completing the extra project task of installing the WordPress plugin by hosting the Zoom meetup. I advised the members who didn't attend my meeting to utilize the installed plugin. 


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

We identify the wide options of the WordPress plugins during the extra project activity. We learned about the different useful functions of using plugins while acknowledging its security risks. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

The process of installing a WordPress plugin was my self-directed learning. Using my intuition and previous knowledge, I have learned to install a plugin in the school's WordPress site and utilize it.
