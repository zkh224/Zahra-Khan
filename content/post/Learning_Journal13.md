My learning report for the thirteenth  week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

For this week, we learned about the e-commerce side of the content management system. There are different models to earn money while running the website like sponsorship and crowdfunding. I have also learned the opening an online store is not always the best option from the reading. 


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

For this week, we didn't compare different kinds of content management systems., but we compare different options to earn money for a WordPress site.

**I can manage content using established workflows.**

I was a developer for my group's blog post this week. I created the HTML content early before writers can add their work in the WordPress editor. For the extra project assignment of adding menus, we had the workflow during the Zoom meeting. I and Alejandro navigated the school WordPress site in adding the menu item while the rest of the group members provide us suggestions. We finished the menu tab extra assignment that we did another extra assignment of administration task where we discussed the permissions for each role. Doing the workflow in the Zoom meeting helped us to finish the tasks effectively. 
We also participated in the workflow when installing a WordPress widget on the website. We explored the WordPress widget options during the Zoom meeting and pick the one that would be most functional for the class website. We choose the calendar widget because it is easy to find the blog posts from a certain date. 


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

I can identify money-making models on the internet such as crowdfunding, advertising, sponsorship, affiliated links, and more.  This helps me understand why content creators or businesses prefer one money-making model over another. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

 I use my self-learning in exploring WordPress plugins for earning money in the explore assignment. I found the [Pretty Links plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pretty-link) that creates customized affiliated links and counts the number of click per link. There is also a [WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ad-inserter/#description) that allows inserting ads in any area of a website.
