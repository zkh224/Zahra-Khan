My learning report for the twelfth  week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

We learned about using plugins and other forms of extensions for the WordPress site. There are pros and cons to using these applications. The biggest advantage of extending the CMS is having the ability to customize the website for front-end and back-end for our advantage. However, the biggest drawback is the security vulnerability. It is important to choose a WordPress plug-in or other extension that would benefit our needs without sacrificing security.   


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

For this week, we didn't compare different kinds of content management systems.  


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

I was taking the administrator role for this week's blogpost. I monitor my group's workflow and make sure there is work progress. I communicate with the team members individually about their tasks. My role involves creating an efficient workflow for a good outcome.

We also participated in the workflow when installing a WordPress widget on the website. We explored the WordPress widget options during the Zoom meeting and pick the one that would be most functional for the class website. We choose the calendar widget because it is easy to find the blog posts from a certain date. 

**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

I can identify different kinds of plug-ins and extensions offered by CMSs. Some are used for the visual web design and other front-end aspects while others are used for the back-end like the SEO tools. I can differentiate between a plug-in and a widget because of the explore and the extra project assignment. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

 I use my self-learning time in exploring different kinds of WordPress plug-ins. I chose two plug-ins that I find most useful and interesting for the explore assignment. During my exploration, I read about the functionality of the plug-ins and the demo process. I have also looked into possible security vulnerabilities.  Researching about the plug-ins have helped me to understand my needs if I am running a website.
