My learning report for the seventh week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

I can identify the specific CMS features for this week. I learn how to choose the right CMS based on Barker's suggestions such as comparing apples to apples (whole CMS systems) instead of slices (judging based on a few features). 


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

We learned about comparing features of WordPress and Hugo. Each CMS system offers different features and editing process which depends on a person's needs. I have learned that WordPress suits my needs better because of its user-friendly publishing process and wide customization features.


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

The workflow with my group's second assignment was better than last week. We begin to plan earlier which helps us to progress the work on time. My role for this week is the editor where I write half of the blog post about VR technology. 


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

This week, I learned about WordPress and Hugo features. For example, I  researched about WordPress's wide offering of plugins with different functions. I found [this plug-in](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pinterest-pin-it-button-on-image-hover-and-post/) of adding Pinterest button hover on the images. These plug-ins can enhance WordPress websites. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

My self-directed learning for this week is browsing Hugo and WordPress systems to compare its features. I have browsed Hugo themes which each has different instructions and customization options. For WordPress, I browsed the plug-ins for different functions for the blog such as [improving SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) or adding [a Pinterest button](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pinterest-pin-it-button-on-image-hover-and-post/)
