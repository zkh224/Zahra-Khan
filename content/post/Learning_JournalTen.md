My learning report for the tenth week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

For this week we learned about the CMS topic of content modeling. There are different components of content modeling such as content types, content relationships, attributes, and datatypes. After learning the definitions, we apply our understanding by detecting the components of content modeling in Hugo and WordPress. 


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

I have learned to compare the content modeling system in Hugo versus WordPress. I noticed that Hugo has more content attributions than WordPress. I would say that WordPress has more indirect attributes since it does more automated tasks for the user compare to Hugo. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

This week we are back to our normal workflow routine of posting the weekly WordPress post. My role is the developer where I use my HTML and CSS skills in modifying the presentation of the content. 


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

I can identify the content type, attribute, and datatype for different kinds of websites. For example, I can distinguish between a "page" and "post" even though they are synonymously used. A "post" is a kind of webpage while a webpage can be a post or other else. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

I want to spice up the CSS style of the title, so I resorted to web research to learn new CSS tips. The websites I found have tutorials for adding gradient effect which I have gone through the trial and error process of playing around with different colors and gradient angles in CSS coding. After the long experimentation, I have made three kinds of CSS styles which I have added to the titles and headings. It makes our WordPress post stylish with low highlight and gradient effects.
