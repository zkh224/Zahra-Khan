My learning report for the second week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

I have better understanding about the Markdown elements. I learned that formatting text in Hugo website is called "Markdown". I did use bold and adding link styles in the first week, but I didn't know they fall under the Markdown syntax. It helped me to differentiate between HTML and Markdown markup languages. 


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

We didn't learn about the content management system outside of Hugo yet, hence this question is not applicable for this week. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

I have learned to manage image content in GitHub repository. I did the step-by-step process of adding images on my website. I have also learned to add a new "About" menu button on my homepage by adding the code in the config file. 


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

I understood better about how HTML are interrelated to the content management system. Some HTML elements like the table tag work on the Markdown coding which makes it easy to add an extra style that is otherwise not available for the Markdown syntax. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

I have compared HTML/CSS coding and the website to puzzle out the purpose of the code pieces in the Explore activity. I went to the Markdown guide websites like this [one](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) to learn the differences between HTML and Markdown coding.
