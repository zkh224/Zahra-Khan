My learning report for the eleventh week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

For this week we learned about the CMS topic of content aggregation. I learned about different shapes of content aggregation which impacts the relationships between different contents. For example, serial content is a user-friendly content aggregation for mobile design because users can scroll down continuously. The dominant content aggression used in a platform is called content geography.  


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

I identified content aggression types in WordPress and Hugo CMS platforms. They have different content geographies in their back-end editing system. Hugo has hierarchal content aggregation because of their repository system of "branches" and "folders", representing strong hierarchy relationships. WordPress on the other hand has serial content aggression because their editing options are organized into lists even the Media page. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

Our blog post workflow went smoothly, but not for the Omeka task. I think the reason why there are challenges in exploring Omeka together as a group because the extra assignment is new to us. We ended up working on the Omeka task at our individual times. We planned to discuss together about what we found in Omeka afterwards. I hope our workflow of doing extra assignments would be smoother next time. 

**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

I can identify the features in the Omeka CMS. I learned that the purpose of Omeka is displaying collections like the museum art gallery. I added an item of the ancient Egyptian art in Omeka where I learned to add attributions like title, source, date, type, and other information. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

 When I first logged in to Omeka, I do not know what to do with the new CMS so I went to the Omeka beginner tutorials on YouTube. After watching these tutorials, I added the first item based on the instructions I know. I have successfully added an item and collection in Omeka, but the thumbnail image wasn't showing right. I researched about that problem in the [Omeka Support Group](https://forum.omeka.org/t/show-thumbnails-on-items/5975) and found out it had to do with the admin configurations. I do not have access to the admin configurations to fix the thumbnail, but at least I gained basic knowledge of using Omeka CMS.
