My learning report for the fourteenth  week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

The main topic of this week is multi-channel content distribution. We learn about different methods of distributing content to various social media and other networking sites. For the reading, we learn about the presentation methods to make the content outreach successful.


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

For this week, we didn't compare different kinds of content management systems.


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

I was an editor for this week's blog post. The workflow consists of my communication with the co-editor to complete the post about therapy pet robots. For the extra project assignment, our workflow happened in the Zoom meeting where we discussed WordPress permission controls for each role (administrator, editor, and developer).


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

I can identify content distribution methods that many content creators and businesses use. Some use the same content across different channels while others opt for different content for each channel. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

 I use my self-learning in exploring WordPress plugins for multichannel content distribution in the explore assignment. I found the [Blog2Social](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blog2social/) that automatically creates and publishes social media posts for a WordPress site.
