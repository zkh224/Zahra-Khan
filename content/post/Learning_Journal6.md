My learning report for the sixth week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

This week, we learned about using WordPress to publish our blog posts for the rest of the semester. Now I can identify the tools in WordPress editor to create the post. 


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

We learned about WordPress which its CMS is different from Hugo. I notice the differences between WordPress and Hugo such as the file system and markup languages. I consider WordPress to be a simplified alternative to Hugo since both average and technology-proficient users can use it. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

I worked with my group for our first blog assignment. My role this week is editing the HTML/CSS code to add presentation elements. I organized the content not only because to look aesthetically pleasing, but also to make it easy to read. I have to admit that I wish our workflow begins earlier instead of doing a few days before the deadline. Despite that, we communicated about creating the expectation of better workflow for the following weeks. 


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

I can identify different functions in the WordPress dashboard. Media is my favorite feature because adding photos in the Media Library is very useful and convenient. For example, if I am editing a blog and I want to add the image, I can select it directly from the Media Library instead of having to go on an external link and researching. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

I use [WordPress Support](https://wordpress.com/support/create/) and [WPBeginner](https://www.wpbeginner.com/) to learn how to use HTML editor in WordPress. Because of the WordPress updates, I am re-learning in using the editor since it is different from the last time I used it. I have gained skills in adding style elements in our WordPress blog because of these guides.
